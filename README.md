# MIPI_VA-Model
This model is for your reference.
This model presents a MIPI(Mobile Industry Processor Interface) D-PHY (physical layer) analog part that meets the MIPI Alliance standard that supports high-speed(HS) transmitter (HS-TX) and receiver
(HS-RX) modes as well as low-power(LP)-TX,LP-RX,and LP-contention detection(CD) modes.MIPI is a flexible,source synchronous serial interface standard connecting a host processor to display and
camera modules on mobile devices.The standard supports signal levels of 1.2Vpp at 10Mbp sin LPmode and 0.2Vpp at 80â€“1000Mbps in HSmode.
